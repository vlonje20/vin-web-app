        Keys to success:
        The very first key to success is to make a plan.
        This means having a clear picture of what a successful life looks like to you and
        putting together a well-defined set of goals to get you to that life.
        To succeed means to accomplish a goal.
        By this definition, if you don't set goals, you'll never succeed.
        Key for successful life is dedication, hard work, motivation,
        love towards what you do and importantly, consistency.

        About DevOps: Other than it being a cross-functional combination (and a portmanteau) 
        of the terms and concepts for "development" and "operations", academics and 
        practitioners have not developed a universal definition for the term "DevOps".
        Most often, DevOps is characterized by key principles: shared ownership, workflow 
        automation, and rapid feedback.
        From an academic perspective, Len Bass, Ingo Weber, and Liming Zhu — three computer 
        science researchers from the CSIRO and the Software Engineering Institute — suggested 
        defining DevOps as "a set of practices intended to reduce the time between committing 
        a change to a system and the change being placed into normal production, while 
        ensuring high quality".
        However, the term is used in multiple contexts. At its most successful, DevOps is a 
        combination of specific practices, culture change, and tools.
